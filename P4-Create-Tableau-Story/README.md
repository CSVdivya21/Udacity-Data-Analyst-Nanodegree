## Summary

Finding solutions for feeding the growing world population has become a hot topic for food and agriculture organizations. This tableau visualization project provides an insight on our worldwide food production - focusing on a comparison between food produced for human consumption and feed produced for animals. I am interested in knowing the fastest growing countries in terms of food production/consumption. I have explored the total production (food and feed) year-wise, item-wise and country-wise. Exploring the food production globally on a world map was also my interest.

## Design

The incorporated the following design changes into my project :-
1.I have melted the year columns Y1961, Y1962,…etc of original dataset (FAO.csv) to produce ‘Year’ and ‘Production’ columns and saved it as ‘Food production.csv’, which I used for the project.
2.I made my visualizations interactive by adding filters and animations into them, as suggested in the feedback given by viewers. 
3.I chose bar charts so as to show distribution of production year-wise and country-wise, also I used line graph to see year wise trend in food vs feed production.
4.I made the story titles more descriptive as per the viewers feedback.

## Feedback

I added my visualization in the slack group and discussion forum. I received the following feedback in the forum (no feedback in chat):
"I'd like to suggest that the story titles can be made a bit more clear and descriptive. Also make titles relevant to the plots shown.
Add animations and filters to make the visualizations more interactive. This drives the reader to get immediate insights from the plots by just interacting with them using filter options."
