# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## About

This repository contains all of my core and optional projects done for Udacityâ€™s Data Analyst Nanodegree (short: DAND) programme. Language of instruction was primarily Python and R. The course was well designed to meet the skill requirements of data analyst. The projects are adequate enough to test the learned skills.

1. P1 : Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
2. P2 : Explore and Summarize Data
3. P3 : Wrangle and Analyze Data
