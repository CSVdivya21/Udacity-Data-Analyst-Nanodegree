# Explore and Summarize Data : Prosper Loan Data

## Background Information

Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that aims to connect people who need money with those who have money to invest. In this Exploratory Data Analysis, I explore a Prosper dataset containing loan information for over a 100,000 people between the years 2006 and 2013. The data is provided by Udacity as a part of Explore and Summarize Data. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information. The exploration is divided into 3 analytical segments in increasing order of complexity: Univariate Plots, Bivariate Plots, and Multivariate Plots, as well as a Reflection segment at the end that summarizes my experience and thoughts throughout this EDA.
